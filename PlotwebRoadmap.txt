# Important (has to be finished before release)

 * Finish R help files for all function
 * Finish markdown file "How to plot"
 * Test all new and old functionality
 * Add more checks for correct inputs
 * Make the spacing between the boxes more configurable 

# Nice to have

 * Make the size of the boxes configurable with an option 
 * Auto generated legend 
    - Automatic abbreviating of labels
    - Different options with numbers, characters, or shortened species names
 * Sorting 2 webs with as few crossings as possible 
 * Making the margins and positions of the plots configurable 
 * Adding the option for double labels in plot2webs
 * Plot the labels inside the boxes
 * Make alpha channel a list so that it can be configured for every link individually 
 * Option to group species together, so that they share a color
   and are plotted with some distance to other groups
    - Sorting algorithms should be adapted to that 
    - Could be implemented with nested named list
    - inner group distance between group distance 

 # Designfragen 

  * Lieber eigene Parameter für Italic, Rotation, etc. oder über par-Argumente (font, srt) definieren?
  * Do we need an option to flip the plot or is it enough to document that transposing the web in the function call does the same?
  * Should wrong inputs be handled each with a separate error message or is stopifnot sufficient?
